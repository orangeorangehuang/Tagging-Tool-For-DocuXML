# Tagging Tool for DocuXML

This is the VS Code Extension version of the tagging tool for DocuXML. DocuXML is a XML file format based on [DocuXML 1.3 Scheme](https://hackmd.io/@DocuSky/BksNFnEK_) released by the [DocuSky](https://docusky.org.tw/DocuSky/home/) team, NTU CSIE.

This project aims to speed up the tagging progress while processing data from *[Tongzhi](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-tw/%E9%80%9A%E5%BF%97) (Comprehensive Treatises of Chinese Hostory)*, written by Zheng Qiao in the Song dynasty. So the type of tags supported by this tool are customized for different part of the book. Please refer to [Release Notes](##Release-Notes) for more details.

## Features

The tagging tool runs in the backgroud once a XML file is opened in window. 

Highlight the text you would like to tag using the left mouse button, and then right-click the text to see the tag list.
